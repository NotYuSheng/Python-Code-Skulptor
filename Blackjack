# Five Card Charlie not in effect
# The side rule is rarely offered. When it is in effect, a player who collects a hand of five cards 
# (two cards plus three hits) without going bust is immediately paid even money, irrespective of the dealer's hand.
# Dealer always stands on if > 17
# Player must draw onto minimum of 16
